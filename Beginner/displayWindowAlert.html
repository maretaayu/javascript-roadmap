<!-- JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log(). -->

<!-- You can use an alert box to display data: -->
<!-- You can skip the window keyword.

In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional -->
<script>
    alert(10+12);
